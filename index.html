        <h1>Transcontinenetal Indigenous Dialogue</h1>
        <p>The state of current Indigenous affairs in North America is an on-going battle for control over <em>resources</em>. The so-called 'land 
        question' is no longer a question since Aboriginal title has been defined in the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Delgamuukw v. British 
        Columbia</em>, yet resource corporations still manage to have political backing in 1st World countries such as Canada and the USA and use 
        that backing to side-skirt Indigenous Rights and literally bull-doze their way through Indigenous traditional territories to this day. South American relations still struggle under colonial oppression as non-1st world Latin American countries with activists, tribes, environmental and Indigenous leaders targeted with extreme violence stand against their corrupt governments and guerilla groups who work for resource giants.

        <h3>Current South American Issues: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Disproportionate affects from Covid19 virus due to poverty and lack of access to proper medical care.</li>
        <li>Front-line victimization due to lack of responsible government Climate Change policies.</li>
    <li>Continued oppression from guerilla groups targeting tribes for resources and lack of adequate government protections.
    </li>
    <li>Continued colonial oppression due to governmental corruption from pressure from resource-extraction companies </li></ul>
    <p>The state of Indigenous groups in South America is <em>dire</em>. Those with power continue to oppress tribes for their resources. Those who
        stand against the powerful tend to die at the hands of guerilla warfarers who are funded by corporations 
        and it is said that corrupt officials are also at fault, as <strong>government corruption has been a known problem for 
        many S. American countries</strong> where resource-extraction and climate-change issues loom largest.
